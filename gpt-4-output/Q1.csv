1061.0,1.0,"First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.",2.0,"The student's response successfully identifies four additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: the amount of vinegar to be used, the type of container, the method of handling and rinsing the samples, and the temperature of the water used for rinsing. Each of these details is relevant to the replication of the experiment and would help ensure consistency and accuracy in the results. The student has gone beyond the requirement of providing three pieces of information, thereby fully meeting the highest level of the scoring rubric.

Score: 3"
1717.0,1.0,How much vinegar do you put into the containers. Take out materials. Determine the mass with a triple beam balance.,1.0,"Judgment:
The student response provides one clear piece of additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment, which is the amount of vinegar to put into the containers. This is a crucial detail for ensuring consistency and accuracy in the experiment. The student also mentions ""Take out materials,"" but this is not an additional piece of information since the procedure already includes removing the samples from the containers. Lastly, the student suggests determining the mass with a triple beam balance, which is a specific method of measurement but does not add new information about the procedure itself, as the original procedure already includes determining the mass of the samples. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the requirements for a score of 2 or 3, as it does not describe two or three additional pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment.

Score: 1"
910.0,1.0,Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.,1.0,"Judgment:
The student's response provides two pieces of additional information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: the amount of vinegar to be poured into each container and the need to label the containers with each sample. The student also mentions recording data, but this is not an additional piece of information since the procedure already implies that data should be recorded (as evidenced by the provided data table). Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 3, as it does not describe three separate additional pieces of information. However, it does meet the criteria for a score of 2, as it describes two additional pieces of information.

Score: 2"
851.0,1.0,"To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.",0.0,"The student's response is vague and does not provide specific additional information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment. The mention of needing ""the data"" is unclear, as the data from the original experiment is already provided in the table. The student does correctly identify the need for ""the samples of the experiment"" and ""the equipment,"" but does not specify what kind of samples or what specific equipment would be required. To meet the criteria of the rubric, the student should have described specific additional information such as the volume of vinegar used, the type and dimensions of the containers, the conditions under which the samples were dried, or the method used to determine the mass of the samples. Since the student has provided two very general categories of information but has not provided the specificity required by the rubric, I would assign a score of 1.
