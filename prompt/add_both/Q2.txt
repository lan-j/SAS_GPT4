You are a grader for a tenth-grade Science exam in a high school. You will be provided with guidelines, scoring rubric, possible correct answers, scoring examples, a question, and a student's response. Tables, if there are any, will be in CSV format. Rate the response according to the scoring rubric, possible correct responses, and scoring examples. You should reply to the response with rating followed by a paragraph of rationale. For the rating, just report a score only.

# Problem: 

Prompt—Polymer Investigation
A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability.
 
Procedure:
1. Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length.
2. Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table.
3. Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.
4. Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
5. Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.
6. Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
7. Perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1).
 
The student recorded the following data from the investigation.
 
Data Table:
 
Plastic Type,Amount Stretched(mm)
,T1,T2
A,10,12
B,22,23
C,14,13
D,20,20
 
a. Draw a conclusion based on the student’s data.
b. Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results.

# Rubric

Rubric range: 0-3

Scoring rubric: 

Score 0: The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation.
Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.-or-The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data.
Score 2: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.-or-The response describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data.
Score 3: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.

# Sample Response:

Conclusions:
Plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics.
Plastic sample A has the least amount of stretchability compared to the other polymer plastics.
Not all polymer plastics have the same stretchability.
Different polymer plastics have different stretchability (and are therefore suited for different applications).
A reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors.
Other reasonable conclusions

Experimental Design Improvements:
Provide the before and after measurements for length (Did the samples all start out the same size?).
Make sure the samples are all of the same thickness. Variations in thickness could have caused variations in stretchability.
Perform additional trials. Some of the samples have similar stretchability (A and C, B and D). Two trials may not be enough to conclusively state that one is more stretchable than the other.
Indicate how many weights were added to the clamps (Was it the same number for each sample?).
Other acceptable responses

# Scoring Examples

Score 0 example: "Test 1 was good. Test 2 for plastic type A and B streched longer than Test 1. They could have had more different kinds of plastics and kept the weights on."
Notes: The student appears to be comparing trials rather than plastic types and does not provide a valid conclusion. “They could have had more different kinds of plastics and kept the weights on” are not valid ways to improve the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.

Score 1 example: "The conclusion of this lab is that plastic B stretched the most. The students could have improved the experiment by saying what type of the plastic they used, and how high the table was that the plastic was hanging from."
Notes: The student provides an acceptable conclusion based on the data: “…plastic B stretched the most.” Two ways to improve the experimental design and/or the validity of the results are given, but they are irrelevant and do not receive credit: “…saying what type of plastic they used, and how high the table was that the plastic was hanging from.”

Score 2 example: "A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of the four samples. In both trials is stretched more min then any of the other plastics. B) The first way the experiment could have been improved was by more thoroughly explaining the procedures. Another way for improvement is by doing more trials that will always give more acurate and more valid data."
Notes: The student provides an acceptable conclusion based on the data: “Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of the four samples.” One correct way to improve the experimental design and/or the validity of the results is given: “…by doing more trials.” Explaining the procedures more thoroughly is too vague to be considered an improvement to the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.

Score 3 example: "Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most, plastic type D stretched the second most, plastic type C stretched the third most, and plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results are having a set weight of the weights added every 5 minutes, have a set length for the plastics at the start of the test."
Notes: The student provides an acceptable conclusion based on the data: “…plastic type B stretched the most.…” Two correct ways to improve the experimental design and/or validity of the results are given: “…having a set weight of the weights…” and “…have a set length for the plastics at the start of the test.” Adding weights every 5 minutes is a minor error and does not affect the final score of the response.
