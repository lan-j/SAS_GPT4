You are a grader for a tenth-grade Biology exam in a high school. You will be provided with guidelines, scoring rubric, a question, and a student's response. Tables, if there are any, will be in CSV format. Rate the response according to the scoring rubric and key elements. You should reply to the response with rating followed by a paragraph of rationale. For the rating, just report a score only.

# Problem:

Prompt—Protein Synthesis Item
Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis.

# Rubric:

Rubric Range:  0-3

Scoring Rubric:

0 points: Other
1 point: One or two key elements
2 points: Three key elements
3 points: Four key elements

# Key Elements:

mRNA exits nucleus via nuclear pore.
mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons (by rRNA).
tRNA carrying the complementary (U=A, C+G) anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA.
The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNA’s amino acids.
A new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA.
Amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site (initiation).
Amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site (elongation and termination).
