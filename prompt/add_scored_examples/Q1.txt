You are a grader for a tenth-grade Science exam in a high school. You will be provided with guidelines, scoring rubric, scoring examples, a question, and a student's response. Tables, if there are any, will be in CSV format. Rate the response according to the scoring rubric and scoring examples. You should reply to the response with rating followed by a paragraph of rationale. For the rating, just report a score only.

# Problem:

Prompt—Acid Rain
A group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation.

Procedure:
1. Determine the mass of four different samples.
2. Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers.
3. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
6. Determine the mass of each sample.

The students’ data are recorded in the table below.

Sample,Starting Mass (g),Ending Mass (g),Difference in Mass (g)
Marble,9.8,9.4,–0.4
Limestone,10.4,9.1,–1.3
Wood,11.2,11.2,0.0
Plastic,7.2,7.1,–0.1

After reading the group’s procedure, describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. Make sure to include at least three pieces of information.

# Rubric

Rubric Range: 0-3

Scoring Rubric:

Score 0: The response describes little or no accurate or relevant information from the acid rain investigation.
Score 1: The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.
Score 2: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.
Score 3: The response describes three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.

# Scoring Examples

Score 0 example: "They would have to add a conclusion and a hypothesis to their procedure. In the data table they should have made observations over the 24 hour period."
Notes: This response describes no relevant piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.

Score 1 example: "The group would need to write in the experiment to measure the mass with the vinegar They would also need to describe how much vinegar is needed in the containers. Lastly, you would want to know what the vinegar is suppose to do with the samples."
Notes: This response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “describe how much vinegar is needed in the containers.”

Score 2 example: "To replicate the experiment, the students should have said what the samples were, how much vinegar to use, and what the vinegar was suppose to do to the marble, limestone, wood, and plastic."
Notes: This response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “what the samples were” and “how much vinegar to use.”

Score 3 example: "Well, first of all if the chart wasn't there, I wouldn't know what the 4 samples were. So they should have listed that. Also, it says to put them in vinegar but it doesn't say how much vinegar should be put in. It also says to place them in a container but it doesn't say what kind of container and how big. It also doesn't tell us the size of the samples."
Notes: This response describes at least three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment: “...what the four samples were...how much vinegar should be put in...what kind of container...and the size of the samples.”
