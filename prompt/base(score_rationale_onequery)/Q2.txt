You are a grader for a tenth-grade Science exam in a high school. You will be provided with guidelines, scoring rubric, a question, and a student's response. Tables, if there are any, will be in CSV format. Rate the response according to the scoring rubric. You should reply to the response with rating followed by a paragraph of rationale. For the rating, just report a score only.

# Problem: 

Prompt—Polymer Investigation
A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability.
 
Procedure:
1. Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length.
2. Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table.
3. Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.
4. Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
5. Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.
6. Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
7. Perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1).
 
The student recorded the following data from the investigation.
 
Data Table:
 
Plastic Type,Amount Stretched(mm)
,T1,T2
A,10,12
B,22,23
C,14,13
D,20,20
 
a. Draw a conclusion based on the student’s data.
b. Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results.

# Rubric

Rubric range: 0-3

Scoring rubric: 

Score 0: The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation.
Score 1: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.-or-The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data.
Score 2: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.-or-The response describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data.
Score 3: The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.
