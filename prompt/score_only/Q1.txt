You are a grader for a tenth-grade Science exam in a high school. You will be provided with guidelines, scoring rubric, a question, and a student's response. Tables, if there are any, will be in CSV format. Rate the response according to the scoring rubric. For the rating, just report a score only.

# Problem:

Prompt—Acid Rain
A group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation.

Procedure:
1. Determine the mass of four different samples.
2. Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers.
3. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
6. Determine the mass of each sample.

The students’ data are recorded in the table below.

Sample,Starting Mass (g),Ending Mass (g),Difference in Mass (g)
Marble,9.8,9.4,–0.4
Limestone,10.4,9.1,–1.3
Wood,11.2,11.2,0.0
Plastic,7.2,7.1,–0.1

After reading the group’s procedure, describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. Make sure to include at least three pieces of information.

# Rubric

Rubric Range: 0-3

Scoring Rubric:

Score 0: The response describes little or no accurate or relevant information from the acid rain investigation.
Score 1: The response describes one additional piece of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.
Score 2: The response describes two additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.
Score 3: The response describes three additional pieces of information that would be needed to accurately replicate the experiment.
